                        <h2>My Family</h2>
                            <p>I live in a family comprised of <strong> 8 people </strong>. There is Aileen (my mom), Jeffrey (my dad), 
                            Jennifer (18), Christine (16), Me (15), Michael (12), Kevin (10), and Cosette (4). My oldest sister currently 
                            is a Freshman attending college at UC Berkeley, Christine is a Junior, I am a Sophomore, Michael is in 8th grade,
                            Kevin is in 5th grade, and Cosette goes to preschool. We all like to play soccer and create art!</p>
                
                        <h2>Art</h2>
                            <p> I have been living around art for as long as I can remember. When I was younger, my siblings and I would 
                            watch our dad create art pieces and we would try to make ones too, and by second grade I started taking art classes. 
                            Today, me and my siblings all love to do art. <a href="images/artportfolio.html">Here</a> is a link to a portfolio of the
                            art pieces that I have made.</p>
                
                        <h2>Sports</h2>
                            </p> Along with doing art, all of my siblings and I love to play and watch sports. We all play soccer, my sisters 
                            and I play volleyball, my brothers play basketball, and we all follow the NBA. My sister and I play for our high school 
                            team for volleyball and soccer and my brothers play for their school basketball teams. To find our volleyball game schedule,

            <p align="center">In our programming class, we are learning about what <strong>HTML</strong> is and what <strong>CSS</strong> is and the 
            different parts that make them (tags, elements, links, etc.). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contain">
            <h2><u>HTML</u></h2>
            <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It is a basic way of 
            creating a website on the world <br>wide web using tags and hyperlinks. The following is a list of tags that one might use to create a website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;:</strong> this is the head of the HTML. It gives basic information <br> 
                for the document such as title, meta info., and style!</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;:</strong> this is the body element. It is responsible for all of the <br> 
                information that is visually displayed on a webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;:</strong> this is the header tag. &lt;h1&gt; is for the biggest header and <br>
                &lt;h6&gt; is for the smallest.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;:</strong> these are opening and closing paragraph tags. They are used for <br> 
                chunks of text on a webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;:</strong> this is a table tag. It can be used to organize information.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;:</strong> &lt;ul&gt; stands for "unordered list". <br> 
                It will create a list with bullet points. On the other hand, &lt;ol&gt;, <br>
                which stands for "ordered list", will create a numbered list.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;img src= &#x201c;&#x201d; width= &#x201c;&#x201d; alt= &#x201c;&#x201d;/&gt;:</strong> this is <br> 
                how one would link an image to a website.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;a href= &#x201c;&#x201d;&gt; link &lt;/a&gt;:</strong> this is how one would link one website <br>
                to another website.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="contain">
            <h2><u>CSS</u></h2>
            <p>CSS stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heet. There are three ways to incorporate CSS into an HTML file:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>an external style sheet:</strong> this is when you link a CSS file into an HTML file, allowing one to <br> 
                create the CSS style sheet for multiple pages. </li>
                <li><strong>an internal style sheet:</strong> this is when the CSS is put into the head of an HTML file through <br> 
                &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;, creating styling specific to the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>an inline style <em>attribute</em>:</strong> this would go into the opening tag of an element and it <br>
                would have styling specific to the element it is in.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 align="center" style="background-color: #53BC84">Takeaways From Programming</h1>
        <div class="thinking">
            <h3>Interval 1:</h3>
                <p>There is a lot more to programming then just tags, elements, and links. Within the first week of programming, I have gotten better at patience, 
                problem solving, and other thinking skills. Prior to this class I was completely new to code, and being patient with the learning process definitely
                helped make it easier to learn. Problem solving was, and still is, the biggest part of learning to program. I made/make a lot of mistakes and I am 
                still figuring how many aspects of code work, and being able to use patience and problem-solving skills has helped me grow not only as a student learning code, 
                but also as a person.</p>
                <img src="images/patience.jpg" alt="image of a thinking symbol" width="250px" border="2px solid #53BC84"> 
            <h3>Interval 2:</h3>
                <p>The second interval has brought with it many challenges. Learning JavaScript in itself is pretty tough, but the added obstacles of using things like arrays 
                really tested our work ethic and our perseverance. This round has taught me to push past my limits and not be afraid to try something new, even if I had just 
                witnessed my experienced friend struggle with it the previous day. I learned that it is really up to myself and my mindset when it comes to trying to overcome 
                a barrier. This round of expeditions as a whole also helped me learn how valuable time is. With two very hard classes, I learned not only how crucial it is to spend time 
                wisely, but also that it is okay to step back from the work and just refresh my mind. </p>
            <h3>Interval 3:</h3>
                <p>The greatest take away that my interval-three-experience has taught me is how to think of programming in more of an abstract kind of way. Previously, we've been working in 
                mind set of "this is HTML" "this is CSS" "this is JavaScript". Now, I have been given the opportunity to play around with all of these individual aspects of programming and try 
                to put them all together and see how they can build upon each other to make a more advanced webpage. I was pretty stumped when I started this project beacuse I didn't know how to 
                manipulate the different uses of the DOM and how to incorporate it into basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and processing. Now that I have had this experience, though, I think I can 
                really go much further and advance the work that I have been creating</p><br>
                <p>This interval has also changed the concept of "interacting". Previously, I would've considered my interval two work an "interaction", but now I understand that I perhaps more
                accurate definition would be taking the input of the user, or whoever is on the other side of the screen, and giving back an output that they can either see or hear.</p>
            <h3>Interval 4:</h3>
                <p>This last interval was, unfortunately, quite short and rushed; we did all of the checkpoints in one day and after we found out that we had less than a week to finish the enitre 
                project. It really put our skills to the test. I'm really sad to finish off this years expeditions because I have developed a love and passion for both programming and my other class
                psychology. I came into our first programming class knowing aboslutely nothing and being quite doubtful about my ability to keep up with the work, but the support of my classmates, our 
                amazing teacher's aid, and our phenomenal teacher surely did prove me wrong. This round of expeditions has brought up new career paths for me to choose from and I am forever grateful. 
                My friend and I were offered to continue this work by TA-ing for the journalism teacher. We unfortunately decided to decline, for other people may want it more and it wasn't exactly what
                we would like to use our newly learned skills for. Instead, we are going to work together to set up websites for the various clubs at our school. This will not only make a greater
                community impact, but it will also keep our programming skills sharp. (Thank you, Mr. Hesby (,: !!)</p>
