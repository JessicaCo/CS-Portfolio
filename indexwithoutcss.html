            <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>I live in a family comprised of <strong> 8 people </strong>. There is Aileen (my mom), Jeffrey (my dad), 
            Jennifer (18), Christine (16), Me (15), Michael (12), Kevin (10), and Cosette (4). My oldest sister currently 
            is a Freshman attending college at UC Berkeley, Christine is a Junior, I am a Sophomore, Michael is in 8th grade,
            Kevin is in 5th grade, and Cosette goes to preschool. We all like to play soccer and create art!</p>

            <h2>Art</h2>
            <p> I have been living around art for as long as I can remember. When I was younger, my siblings and I would 
            watch our dad create art pieces and we would try to make ones too, and by second grade I started taking art classes. 
            Today, me and my siblings all love to do art. <a href="images/artportfolio.html">Here</a> is a link to a portfolio of the
            art pieces that I have made.</p>

            <h2>Sports</h2>
            </p> Along with doing art, all of my siblings and I love to play and watch sports. We all play soccer, my sisters 
            and I play volleyball, my brothers play basketball, and we all follow the NBA. My sister and I play for our high school 
            team for volleyball and soccer and my brothers play for their school basketball teams. To find our volleyball game schedule,

        <div>
            <p align="center">In our programming class, we are learning about what <strong>HTML</strong> is and what <strong>CSS</strong> is and the 
            different parts that make them (tags, elements, links, etc.). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contain">
            <h2><u>HTML</u></h2>
            <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It is a basic way of 
            creating a website on the world <br>wide web using tags and hyperlinks. The following is a list of tags that one might use to create a website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;:</strong> this is the head of the HTML. It gives basic information <br> 
                for the document such as title, meta info., and style!</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;:</strong> this is the body element. It is responsible for all of the <br> 
                information that is visually displayed on a webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;:</strong> this is the header tag. &lt;h1&gt; is for the biggest header and <br>
                &lt;h6&gt; is for the smallest.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;:</strong> these are opening and closing paragraph tags. They are used for <br> 
                chunks of text on a webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;:</strong> this is a table tag. It can be used to organize information.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</strong> &lt;ul&gt; stands for "unordered list". <br> 
                It will create a list with bullet points. On the other hand, &lt;ol&gt;, <br>
                which stands for "ordered list", will create a numbered list.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;img src= &#x201c;&#x201d; width= &#x201c;&#x201d; alt= &#x201c;&#x201d;/&gt;:</strong> this is <br> 
                how one would link an image to a website.</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;a href= &#x201c;&#x201d;&gt; link &lt;/a&gt;:</strong> this is how one would link one website <br>
                to another website.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="contain">
            <h2><u>CSS</u></h2>
            <p>CSS stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heet. There are three ways to incorporate CSS into an HTML file:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>an external style sheet:</strong> this is when you link a CSS file into an HTML file, allowing one to <br> 
                create the CSS style sheet for multiple pages. </li>
                <li><strong>an internal style sheet:</strong> this is when the CSS is put into the head of an HTML file through <br> 
                &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;, creating styling specific to the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>an inline style <em>attribute</em>:</strong> this would go into the opening tag of an element and it <br>
                would have styling specific to the element it is in.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 align="center" style="background-color: #53BC84">Takeaways From Programming</h1>
        <div class="thinking">
            <p>There is a lot more to programming then just tags, elements, and links. Within the first week of programming, I have gotten better at patience, 
            problem solving, and other thinking skills. Prior to this class I was completely new to code, and being patient with the learning process definitely
            helped make it easier to learn. Problem solving was, and still is, the biggest part of learning to program. I made/make a lot of mistakes and I am 
            still figuring how many aspects of code work, and being able to use patience and problem-solving skills has helped me grow not only as a student learning code, 
            but also as a person.</p>
